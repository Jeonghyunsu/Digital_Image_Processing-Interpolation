# Digital_Image_Processing-Interpolation

▶ Bilinear Interpolatoin

Using the bilinear interpolation method, Create a program that enlarges 256x256 images to 436x436 and 512x512 size images.

▶ Rotation

Create a program that rotates the input image by x degrees.

▶ Bicubic Interpolation + Rotation

Creates a console program that receives an arbitrary angle (0 ~ 360) of the input image at the start of the program and rotates it clockwise by that angle.
